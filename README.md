## About / Synopsis

Click the links at the top to see pages about me, my portfolio and how to contact me.  You can see a gallery of photography and how to contact me.  Feel free to contact me through the form provided.

## Features

This is a single-page application portfolio for a photographer. When you load the portfolio, then I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. When viewing the header, you will see the photographer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. View the navigation to see the titles About Me, Portfolio, and Contact, with the title corresponding to the current section highlighted. When you click on a navigation title, the site presents the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

When loading the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default. This shows the About Me section, where you will see a photo of me and a short bio. The Portfolio section shows titled images of six examples of photography. The Contact section provides a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When moving the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you will receive a notification that this field is required. When you enter text into the email address field, you receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address.

When you view the footer, then you will see text information or icons.
